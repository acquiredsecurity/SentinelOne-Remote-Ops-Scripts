# SentinelOne-Remote-Ops-Scripts
SentinelOne Remote Operations PowerShell Scripts

This repository contains a collection of PowerShell scripts designed for automating and managing remote operations and using PowerShell within SentinelOne environments. The scripts are intended to streamline tasks such as agent troubleshooting, incident response and various other tasks. Whether you're managing a large fleet of endpoints or performing security investigations, these scripts can be customized to fit your organization's needs and enhance the efficiency of SentinelOne management.

All scripts are provided as-is and should be thoroughly tested in a controlled environment before being deployed to production systems. I take no responsibility for any issues running these scripts have in your environment, they should be reviewed by somebody with powershell knoweledge amd thoroughly tested in a lab before running.
